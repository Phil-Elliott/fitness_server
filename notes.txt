1) Add testing
- Practice writing unit tests
- Practice writing intergration tests
    - White a script to delete the test data and after the test is run or before the test is run

2) Connect clerk


3) Start building out routes
   - Get the auth working
   - Do tests as you go (make sure works with first route you write)






clerk

Finish routes
add to github (multiple commits)
connect to clerk
add tests
maybe clean up a bit
add more constraints in sql and in code like what was done with update
also maybe this (
    if (!req.body || Object.keys(req.body).length === 0) {
    return next(new Error("No data provided to update."));
  }
) can be used in other places so that you don't have to write the same code over and over again
start practicing vim
